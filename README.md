Project: Digital Clock

Duration: 3 days

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Description:

I created a digital clock that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. 
I used HTML to structure the clock face, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to update the time in real-time.

Key Features:

- Displays current time in hours, minutes, and seconds
- Updates time every second
- Uses JavaScript's Date object to get current time
- CSS animations for smooth time updates

Learning Outcomes:

- Improved understanding of JavaScript's Date object and timing functions
- Enhanced CSS skills for styling and animations
- Practiced using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together for a functional project

Challenges:

- Synchronizing time updates with CSS animations
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility

Conclusion:

Creating a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a great learning experience. I developed my skills in JavaScript timing functions, CSS animations, and HTML structure. I'm proud of my project and look forward to building more interactive web projects!
